title: "Introducing the Shell"
teaching: 5
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is a command shell and why would I use one?"
objectives:
- "Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs."
- "Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces."
keypoints:
- "A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs."
-  "This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix."
-  "Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt."
- "The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for
automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines."
- "The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how
cryptic its commands and operation can be."

### Background

There are many different ways for humans and computers to interact, such clicking a mouse and using menu-driven interactions through a **graphical user interface** (GUI), touch screen interfaces, or speech recognition. But for repetitive tasks, using GUI will take a long time and it is also easier to make some mistakes. This is where we take advantage of the Unix shell. The Unix shell is both a **command-line interface** (CLI) and a scripting language. With the proper commands, you can complete some repetitive task much faster than using a GUI. 


### The Shell

The shell is a program where users can type commands.
With the shell, it's possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash, and it is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

To use shell, you need to learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you're studying. The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of commands can be written into a *script*, improving the reproducibility of workflows.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines, such as cloud computinng systems, and high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, so it is essential to get familiar with shell to run a variety of specialised tools and resources.

Let's get started.

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

~~~
$
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The shell typically uses `$ ` as the prompt, but may use a different symbol.
In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as `$ `.
Most importantly:
when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
*do not type the prompt*, only the commands that follow it.
Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.

The prompt is followed by a **text cursor**, a character that indicates the position where your
typing will appear.
The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe.
You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.

So let's try our first command, `ls` which is short for listing.
This command will list the contents of the current directory:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Command not found
> If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it
> will print an error message such as:
>
> ~~~
> $ ks
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
> ~~~
> ks: command not found
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command
> is not installed.
{: .callout}


## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem

Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist,
has just returned from a six-month survey of the
[North Pacific Gyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre),
where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the
[Great Pacific Garbage Patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch).
She has 1520 samples that she's run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance
of 300 proteins.
She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called `goostats.sh` she inherited.
On top of this huge task, she has to write up results by the end of the month so her paper
can appear in a special issue of *Aquatic Goo Letters*.

The bad news is that if she has to run `goostats.sh` by hand using a GUI,
she'll have to select and open a file 1520 times.
If `goostats.sh` takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours
of Nelle's attention.
With the shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she focuses
her attention on writing her paper.

The next few lessons will explore the ways Nelle can achieve this.
More specifically,
they explain how she can use a command shell to run the `goostats.sh` program,
using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names,
so that her computer can work while she writes her paper.

As a bonus,
once she has put a processing pipeline together,
she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.

In order to achieve her task, Nelle needs to know how to:
- navigate to a file/directory
- create a file/directory
- check the length of a file
- chain commands together
- retrieve a set of files
- iterate over files
- run a shell script containing her pipeline
